In <a title="Binding and Finishing" href="Binding_and_Finishing">binding and finishing</a>, a finishing operation in which a printed <a title="Substrate" href="Substrate">substrate</a> is covered with a clear film, such as a <a title="Primer" href="Primer">primer</a> (usually added as a prelude to printing or other coating operations), a <a title="Lacquer" href="Lacquer">lacquer</a>, a <a title="Barrier Coat" href="Barrier_Coat">barrier coat</a>, or an <a title="Overprint Varnish" href="Overprint_Varnish">overprint varnish</a>. Alternately, only a portion of a printed material may be coated, called <a title="spot coating" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/spot_coating">spot coating</a> or <a title="Spot Varnish" href="Spot_Varnish">spot varnish</a>ing. Coatings applied after printing may either be aqueous (water-based) which dry by evaporation, or electron-beam or ultraviolet coatings which dry by <a title="Polymerization" href="Polymerization">polymerization</a> when exposed to electron beams and ultraviolet light, respectively.

In papermaking, the term <em>coating</em> refers to a paper <a title="Finishing" href="Finishing">finishing</a> operation in which the surface of a paper is covered with a substance to impart a desired finish or texture to the paper and improve its <a title="Printability" href="Printability">printability</a>. Coatings provide a smooth paper surface, and the amount and composition of a particular coating affects such properties as <a title="Ink Absorbency" href="Ink_Absorbency">ink absorbency</a> and <a title="Ink Holdout" href="Ink_Holdout">ink holdout</a>. Coatings also enhance the <a title="Whiteness" href="Whiteness">whiteness</a>, <a title="Opacity" href="Opacity">opacity</a>, and <a title="Gloss" href="Gloss">gloss</a> of paper. 
</p>
<p id="l7">
Coatings are typically made up of <a title="Pigment" href="Pigment">pigment</a>s and <a title="Binder" href="Binder">binder</a>s (also called <a title="Adhesive" href="Adhesive">adhesive</a>s). Pigments are usually made of refined <a title="Clay" href="Clay">clay</a> (which enhances gloss and ink holdout), <a title="Titanium Dioxide" href="Titanium_Dioxide">titanium dioxide</a> (which enhances <a title="Brightness" href="Brightness">brightness</a> and opacity), or <a title="Calcium Carbonate" href="Calcium_Carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> (which enhances <a title="Ink Absorbency" href="Ink_Absorbency">ink absorbency</a>, and brightness). Binders are added to increase the adhesion of the particles of pigment to each other and to the paper fibers. Binders are usually made from common natural sources such as starch, or synthetic sources, such as <a title="Styrene-Butadiene" href="Styrene-Butadiene">styrene-butadiene</a> and <a title="Vinyl Acrylic Latices" href="Vinyl_Acrylic_Latices">vinyl acrylic latices</a>. Natural binders are not water resistant, so synthetic binders are often used in addition to or in place of them. Synthetic binders also are more resistant to cracking when the paper is folded than are natural ones.

<p id="l9">
The <a title="Coat Weight" href="Coat_Weight">coat weight</a> required, or how much coating is added to a <a title="Base Stock" href="Base_Stock">base stock</a> of paper, is a function of the final basis weight of the paper and other end-use considerations. Coatings can either be added on the papermaking machine (called <a title="On-Machine Coating" href="On-Machine_Coating">on-machine coating</a>) or on a separate machine (called <a title="Off-Machine Coating" href="Off-Machine_Coating">off-machine coating</a>). There are a variety of methods used for applying coatings, such as the use of <a title="blade coaters" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/blade_coaters">blade coaters</a>, <a title="air knife coaters" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/air_knife_coaters">air knife coaters</a>, and <a title="cast coaters" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/cast_coaters">cast coaters</a>. Coating can be applied to one side of a paper—called <a title="Coated One Side" href="Coated_One_Side">coated one side</a>—such as is done with paper for labels and book jackets, or coated on both sides—called <a title="Coated Two Sides" href="Coated_Two_Sides">coated two sides</a>. Coated papers are best for printing <a title="Halftone" href="Halftone">halftone</a>s, especially in <a title="Letterpress" href="Letterpress">letterpress</a> printing. The removal of bits of a coating during printing and the effect of those coating particles on the printing system (for example, <a title="Coating Pile" href="Coating_Pile">coating pile</a>, or the collection of particles of coating on the blanket) is a consideration when determining a paper's <a title="Runnability" href="Runnability">runnability</a>. 
</p>
<p id="l11">
In <a title="Screen Printing" href="Screen_Printing">screen printing</a>, the term <em>coating</em> is also used to refer to any screen printed material applied to a <a title="Substrate" href="Substrate">substrate</a> as a continuous film.
