A coloring material used in printing inks, distinguished from a <a title="Pigment" href="Pigment">pigment</a> by its vehicle-solubility, which <a title="Pigment" href="Pigment">pigment</a>s lack. Dyes, though more commonly used in the coloring of textiles, are frequently used in inks to impart a set of desired optical properties—such as transparency, purity, and color strength—not achievable with pigments. Dyes are most commonly used in liquid inks (such as those used in <a title="Gravure" href="Gravure">gravure</a> and <a title="Flexography" href="Flexography">flexography</a>), but special formulations allow some dyestuffs to be added to paste inks used in <a title="Lithography" href="Lithography">lithography</a> and <a title="Screen Process" href="Screen_Process">screen process</a> printing. However, the classification of a dye often overlaps with some pigments. Dyes are frequently used as <a title="Toner" href="Toner">toner</a>s. Some common dyes include <a title="Eosine" href="Eosine">Eosine</a>, <a title="Methyl Violet" href="Methyl_Violet">Methyl Violet</a>, <a title="Victoria Blue" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/Victoria_Blue">Victoria Blue</a>, <a title="Rhodamine B" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/Rhodamine_B">Rhodamine B</a>, and many others. (See also <a title="Pigment" href="Pigment">Pigment</a>.)

Historically, most dyes were obtained from natural sources, such as plants, notably the woad plant ('Isatis tinctoria'), a source of blue dye; the indigo plant ('Indigofera tinctoria'), a source of indigo dye; and some species of madderwort (several species of the genus <em>Rubia</em>, most notably <em>R. tinctorum</em>), a source of a deep red dye (also called madder). Many dyes were also obtained from animals, such as mollusks and insects. However, it took 20,000 mollusks to dye one square yard of fabric, so dyed materials tended to be rare and expensive.

The first synthetic colorants were developed in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, most notably <a title="Prussian Blue" href="Prussian_Blue">Prussian Blue</a>, the first important synthetic pigment, invented in 1704. The first important synthetic dye, <a title="aniline dye" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/aniline_dye">aniline dye</a>, was created by accident in 1856 by William Perkin, who was actually trying synthesize quinine.
