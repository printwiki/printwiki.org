In <a title="Binding and Finishing" href="Binding_and_Finishing">binding and finishing</a>, a process in which images, patterns, or text are stamped or pressed into a <a title="Substrate" href="Substrate">substrate</a>. In the embossing process, a relief <a title="Die" href="Die">die</a> or embossing form is mounted to a platen beneath the substrate to be stamped. A counter embossing form—or a sunken die into which the relief die fits exactly—is mounted to a platen directly above the substrate. During embossing, the two dies are pressed together through the substrate, which creates a raised image. Often, the dies are heated. Embossing which simply stamps an image with no additional coloration or decoration of the pattern is known as <a title="Blind Embossing" href="Blind_Embossing">blind embossing</a>. Embossing which is combined with <a title="Foil Stamping" href="Foil_Stamping">foil stamping</a> to transfer a foil image to the embossed pattern is known as <a title="Foil Embossing" href="Foil_Embossing">foil embossing</a>. 
</p>
<p id="l3">
In the process of <a title="Debossing" href="Debossing">debossing</a>—which is the reverse of embossing, or the created of a sunken image—the positions of the relief die and the counter die are reversed. A similar process in which a sunken image is pressed into a hard book cover or other such substrate is known as <a title="Die-Stamping" href="Die-Stamping">die-stamping</a>. 
</p>
<p id="l5">
Embossing dies are made of brass, magnesium, or copper. Brass is especially useful for long runs. A brass die used in stamping book covers is called a <a title="Binder's Brass" href="Binder's_Brass">binder's brass</a> or, when made from other metals, a <a title="Binder's Die" href="Binder's_Die">binder's die</a>. The image itself can be chemically etched, machine-cut, or hand-tooled. Increasingly, dies are manufactured using lasers guided by <a title="CAD/CAM" href="CAD/CAM">CAD/CAM</a> computer software. Embossing can be done before or after printing. See <a title="Die" href="Die">Die</a> and <a title="Binding and Finishing" href="Binding_and_Finishing">Binding and Finishing</a>.

<p id="l7">
In papermaking, <em>embossing</em> is a paper <a title="Finishing" href="Finishing">finishing</a> operation in which paper is impressed with a raised design. A machine used for embossing is similar to a <a title="supercalender" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/supercalender">supercalender</a>, in which a hard steel roll containing the raised design to be stamped on the paper is in contact with a soft compressible roll. As the paper <a title="Web" href="Web">web</a> passes through the nip of these rolls, the design is stamped on it. The process is used for <a title="Embossed Finish" href="Embossed_Finish">embossed finish</a> papers, and papers with other heavily-textured surfaces. 
</p>
<p id="l9">
In printing, <em>embossing</em> is also an alternate term for the printing and paper defect known as <a title="Waffling" href="Waffling">waffling</a>. (See <a title="Waffling" href="Waffling">Waffling</a>.)
