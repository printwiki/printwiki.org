Terms associated with forecasting include: 
</p>
<p id="l3">
Descriptive statistics: Forecasting software often must be able to alculate the numerical values representing important features of a set of quantitative information, such as the arithmetic mean, range, standard deviation, ratio, percentage and rate of change. 
</p>
<p id="l5">
Regression: Regression is a means for relating one variable to another. Multiple linear regression correlates a variable of interest (the dependent variable) to one or more indepedent variables. Among business applications, this type of program can be used to forecast sales and production levels. 
</p>
<p id="l7">
Correlation analysis: A simple method of measuring the strength of a relaionship between two variables. 
</p>
<p id="l9">
Moving averages: A forecasting technique, moving averages calculates a moving sequence of data to an arithmetic average. 
</p>
<p id="l11">
Exponential smoothing: This is another forecasting technique, based on using weighted sums of past data to forecast a time series. 
</p>
<p id="l13">
Census X-11: A sophisticated decomposition forecasting technique developed at the Department of Labor and used for monthly or quarterly data. 
</p>
<p id="l15">
Box Jenkins: Combines tentative model identification, estimation and diagnostic checking. 
</p>
<p id="l17">
Decomposition method: An approach to forecasting in which a time series consists of a number of unobservable components, such as trend, cycle, seasonality an irregularity. 
</p>
<p id="l19">
Automatic forecasting: Refers to the software's ability to automatically analyze historical data and to apply the most effective forecasting methodology to the data. 
</p>
<p id="l21">
Override automatic forecasting: When the user knows of certain influencing fctors that the software cannot take into account, overriding the automatic forecasting feature is then necessary to obtain the most accurate forecast. 
</p>
<p id="l23">
Bar graph: A graph that illustrates numeric data as a set of evenly spaced bars. 
</p>
<p id="l25">
Line graph: A graphic that represents numeric data as a set of points along a line. 
</p>
<p id="l27">
Histograms: Histograms are graphical representations of a distribution function by means of rectangles. The width of the rectangle represents intervals into which the range of observed values is divided; the height represents the number of observations occurring in each interval. 
</p>
<p id="l29">
Scatter plot: A diagram of corresponding pairs of points that depict a relationship.
