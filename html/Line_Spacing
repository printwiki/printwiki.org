In typography, the space between lines of type, also called <a title="Leading" href="Leading">leading</a> (pronounced "ledding"), <a title="Vertical Spacing" href="Vertical_Spacing">vertical spacing</a>, or <a title="film advance" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/film_advance">film advance</a>. The term <em>leading</em> dates back to metal typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted by hand between lines (i.e., lines were leaded). In linecasting, the line was one unit of metal called a <em>slug</em>. The slug could be cast with an amount of leading "built-in" or added by hand later. If no leading was present at all, the lines were said to be set solid (for example, 10/10). 
</p>
<p id="l3">
Leading should be in proportion to line length and point size—about 20% of the point size—or it should be slightly larger than the optimum word space. Very fine spacing was called <em>carding</em> in hot metal, because pieces of card paper, instead of lead, were inserted; trouble resulted when liquid (i.e., type wash) hit paper slices: columns would suddenly "grow" (expand in depth). 
</p>
<p id="l5">
One of the capabilities that modern typesetting techniques make available is called <a title="Minus Leading" href="Minus_Leading">minus leading</a>. This means that the type is set with a leading value less than the point size, for example, 9 on 8H. Usually, this can be done only with faces that are small on body (small <a title="x-Height" href="x-Height">x-height</a>), have short <a title="Ascender" href="Ascender">ascender</a>s and/or <a title="Descender" href="Descender">descender</a>s, or for all caps. 
</p>
<p id="l7">
Small x-height faces and some sans serifs should have minimal or minus leading. Large x-heights and bold type need more leading. To calculate the minimum amount of leading required between two type lines when changing point sizes, take one-third of the present point size and add it to two-thirds of the point size to be used on the next line. If the leading is not properly set, the lines could overlap one another. 
</p>
<p id="l9">
The most important point to remember is that all leading is measured from <a title="Baseline" href="Baseline">baseline</a> to baseline. In hot metal, it was merely the incremental space between slugs. Today, it is the total space between lines, which is defined by the baseline.
