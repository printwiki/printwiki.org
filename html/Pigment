In papermaking, pigments are fine, inorganic particles added to fill, color, or coat paper. Pigments such as <a title="Clay" href="Clay">clay</a>, <a title="Titanium Dioxide" href="Titanium_Dioxide">titanium dioxide</a>, and <a title="Calcium Carbonate" href="Calcium_Carbonate">calcium carbonate</a> are used as <a title="fillers" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/fillers">fillers</a> and <a title="coatings" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/coatings">coatings</a> in papermaking. When used as a paper coating, the pigment is applied in the presence of a <a title="Binder" href="Binder">binder</a>, which assists the pigment particles in adhering to the paper fibers. (See <a title="Coating" href="Coating">Coating</a>.)

In ink manufacturing, pigments are fine, insoluble, organic or inorganic particles of <a title="Colorant" href="Colorant">colorant</a> that are suspended in the <a title="Vehicle" href="Vehicle">vehicle</a> (which carries the pigment in the ink-transfer process and helps the pigment adhere to the <a title="Substrate" href="Substrate">substrate</a>) and provide not only the color of ink, but also such specific properties as transparency, <a title="Opacity" href="Opacity">opacity</a>, <a title="Specific Gravity" href="Specific_Gravity">specific gravity</a>, and resistance to heat, chemicals, water, or oils. Pigments, therefore, help determine the suitability of the ink to a particular printing process or end use. 
</p>
<p id="l5">
Pigments can be primarily divided into black, white, and colored pigments, and there are a variety of different types of each. <a title="Black pigments" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/Black_pigments">Black pigments</a> include the <a title="Carbon Blacks" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/Carbon_Blacks">Carbon Blacks</a> (including <a title="Furnace Black" href="Furnace_Black">Furnace Black</a>—the most common type of black pigment—and <a title="Channel Black" href="Channel_Black">Channel Black</a>), <a title="Vegetable Black" class="nonexistent" href="http://printwiki.org/Vegetable_Black">Vegetable Black</a>, and <a title="Black Iron Oxides" href="Black_Iron_Oxides">Black Iron Oxides</a>. 
</p>
<p id="l7">
<a title="White Pigments" href="White_Pigments">White pigments</a> come in two varieties, <a title="Opaque Pigment" href="Opaque_Pigment">opaque pigment</a>s and <a title="Transparent Pigment" href="Transparent_Pigment">transparent pigment</a>s. Opaque pigments, as their name implies, reflect light from their surface, and are used to hide the background on which they are printed. Transparent pigments allow light to pass through them, and are commonly added to other, more expensive inks to "pad them out" and reduce the use of expensive pigments. (Transparent pigments are also called <a title="Extender" href="Extender">extender</a>s.) They are also used to reduce the color strength of other inks and to produce tints. 
</p>
<p id="l9">
<a title="Inorganic Color Pigments" href="Inorganic_Color_Pigments">Inorganic color pigments</a> include pigments of varying colors derived from mineral, or inorganic, sources. Inorganic color pigments include "Chromes," "Cadmiums," and "Irons." (See <a title="Inorganic Color Pigments" href="Inorganic_Color_Pigments">Inorganic Color Pigments</a>.) A type of mixture containing co-precipitates of titanium and mica (or other minerals) is used to make a <a title="Pearlescent" href="Pearlescent">pearlescent</a>, which are transparent and highly light-refractive, imparting to the ink film the luster characteristic of mother-of-pearl. (See <a title="Pearlescent" href="Pearlescent">Pearlescent</a>.) 
</p>
<p id="l11">
<a title="Organic Color Pigments" href="Organic_Color_Pigments">Organic Color Pigments</a> are the most widely used pigments and are derived primarily from derivatives of coal tar. Organic color pigments tend to be brighter and stronger than their inorganic counterparts, and the presence of lead in inorganic pigments results in the desire for less toxic substitutes. (See <a title="Organic Color Pigments" href="Organic_Color_Pigments">Organic Color Pigments</a>.) 
</p>
<p id="l13">
<a title="Metallic Powders" href="Metallic_Powders">Metallic powders</a> are, as their name implies, produced from flakes of metal, in varying degrees of fineness and grade. Despite some of their names (such as "Rich Gold" and "Silver"), however, few metallic powder pigments come from precious metals. (See <a title="Metallic Powders" href="Metallic_Powders">Metallic Powders</a>.) 
</p>
<p id="l15">
<a title="Flushed Colors" href="Flushed_Colors">Flushed colors</a> are colored pigments produced in a manner (called <a title="Flushing" href="Flushing">flushing</a>) different from typical pigment manufacture. Typically, pigments begin life as a water suspension of pigment particles, which are then filtered out of the suspension and dried into a presscake. In flushing, the particles are not dried after filtering, but are left with a water content of as much as 80%, and the resulting presscake is mixed with oil, which then disperses the water. Flushing is performed on pigment particles that, in the traditional method of drying, form hard to grind clumps. The paste generated by flushing produces finer-dispersed particles.
