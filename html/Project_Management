Terms associated with project management include: 
</p>
<p id="l3">
Gantt chart: The Gantt chart, named for its developer, Henry L. Gatt, displays the status of various tasks, personnel assignments and costs. It is sometimes referred to as the bar chart. 
</p>
<p id="l5">
PERT chart: The PERT (for program evaluation and review technique) chart illustrates the relationships between tasks; it tracks the progress of each activity from start to finish. It is also referred to as a network chart. 
</p>
<p id="l7">
Resources per project: How many variables (people, equipment and costs, for example) will be considered in the planning of a project? 
</p>
<p id="l9">
Tasks per project: Usually, a more complex project will involve more tasks. Likewise, if project-management software is used to plan simpler projects, fewer tasks will probably be required. 
</p>
<p id="l11">
Links between multiple projects: If projects are dependent on one another for allocation of resources and people, it is beneficial to create links, allowing the manager to have a more complete picture of the interdependent projects. 
</p>
<p id="l13">
Import/Export capabilities: This category indicates whether the package has the ability to import and export data to and from various sources. 
</p>
<p id="l15">
Links to mainframe package: Large projects may require downloading information from a mainframe database. 
</p>
<p id="l17">
Links to spreadsheet package: Interfacing to a spreadsheet package allows printing of project information in spreadsheet format. 
</p>
<p id="l19">
Highlights critical path: The critical path, which outlines the primary tasks involved in a project, allows a manager to control a project by setting up dependencies. If one task deviates from the original plan, the program will alert the manager in advance to the possible resulting problems. 
</p>
<p id="l21">
CPM diagram: Also known as a time-phase network-logic diagram, this chart combines both PERT and Gantt chart features. It may be described as a time-scaled PERT chart because it offers a time frame and displays the interdependencies of the activities within the project. 
</p>
<p id="l23">
Variable-schedule units: The scheduling units take into account the time that is allotted for each task and resource within a project. Some packages will be based on days, while others are based on hours. 
</p>
<p id="l25">
Filtered task report: This feature allows selective reporting on the status of particular tasks as opposed to a general reporting of all the tasks at one time. 
</p>
<p id="l27">
Resource-loading report: This feature gives the user the option to generate reports on the allocation of people, equipment, costs and other resources that are available. 
</p>
<p id="l29">
Allows calendar modifications: If a program allows for calendar modifications, then it will account for specifications in a standard calendar and adjust the project schedule accordingly. 
</p>
<p id="l31">
User interface based on Lotus: A check in this column indicates that the package's user interface is similar to the menu system employed by the popular spreadsheet package 1-2-3, developed by Lotus Development Corp. of Cambridge, Mass.
