In typography, the style of numeral used exclusively until about the tenth century A.D. The Romans—generally speaking—used letters as numbers, such as I (1), V (5), X (10), L (50), C (100), D (500), and M (1,000), but the co-opting of the alphabet to stand in for the number system didn't begin that way. For example, it is believed that the symbol V for 5 was merely representative of an open hand with the fingers held together and the thumb apart, kind of like the Vulcan salute, while the X for (10) is merely a double V, or two crossed hands. The original symbol for 1,000 was a circle with a vertical line through it (similar to the Greek letter <em>phi</em>Ø˜), and the D for 500 is believed to have been simply one-half of this symbol. The original symbol for 100 was a circle with a horizontal line through it (similar to the Greek letter <em>theta</em>Î˜"]). The use of C and M may have come from the first letters of the words <em>centum</em> (meaning "100") and <em>mille</em> ("1,000").

Numbers between these main numbers were typically additive; II was 2, III was 3, VI was six, XI was 11, CI was 101, etc. The subtractive principle came about later; VIIII was often used for 9 in ancient Rome, while today IX is. The Romans were not a mathematically-inclined people, so large numbers were rarely called for.

Roman numerals are typeset just like capital letters are. The <a title="Front Matter" href="Front_Matter">front matter</a> of many books is typically paginated using lowercase Roman numerals (i, ii, iii, iv, etc.).

At the beginning of the second millennium A.D., the so-called <a title="Arabic Numerals" href="Arabic_Numerals">Arabic numerals</a> (actually of Indian origin) were introduced into Western Europe, and within a few centuries proponents of the new numerals defeated those of Roman numerals and by the beginning of the fifteenth century were becoming widely used. (See also <a title="Arabic Numerals" href="Arabic_Numerals">Arabic Numerals</a>.)
