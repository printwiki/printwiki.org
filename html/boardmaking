<strong>Board</strong> <br/>Board is usually defined as paper above an agreed substance (220– <br/>225g/m2 in UK, 250g/m2 in many other countries). It can be single-ply or <br/>multi-ply. The multi-ply structure consists of top liner, under liner, middle <br/>and back liner. Much of the making process is similar to paper. Points <br/>to note include: <br/><strong>Furnish</strong> <br/>Basically the same as for paper, ranging from high-quality bleached pulps <br/>down to recycled waste paper. Stock treatment is basically the same as for <br/>paper. If waste paper is used, more cleaning and screening may be <br/>required. Board is generally given a lesser degree of beating/refining in <br/>order to ensure efficient drainage. <br/>The liner plies are often given conventional beating and refining to <br/>develop their strength while the middle stock is hardly given any mechanical <br/>treatment, just simply broken then lightly refined. <br/><strong>Manufacture</strong> <br/>In multi-ply board, the plies may be combined on-machine or off-machine. <br/>In the case of on-machine boards, either Fourdrinier or vat process <br/>machines may be used. <br/>In the case of the Fourdrinier manufacturing process, the board is built <br/>up on the wire from a series of Inverform units, each of which contains a <br/>head box depositing successive layers on each other. <br/>The vat boardmaker, on the other hand, consists of a number of vats or <br/>cylinder units, in-line, in each of which revolves a large hollow cylinder. <br/>Each cylinder picks up a layer of stock and deposits it on the underside of <br/>a moving felt which carries the first ply of board. The layers are built up <br/>progressively; and at the end of the wire the board is removed for drying. <br/>In the case of off-line finishing, the resulting boards are known as <br/>pasted boards to distinguish them from the homogenous product which <br/>comes off a single machine. A number of webs of board are unreeled in <br/>parallel to each other; adhesive is applied to the top surface of all but the <br/>top sheet; and a pressing cylinder finally brings all the reels together, joining <br/>them to create a single reel of thicker board. The edges are slit to provide <br/>flush edges to the new reel. <br/><strong>Finishing</strong> <br/>The range of operations in finishing corresponds to those for paper and can <br/>include: calendering, supercalendering, coating, slitting, sheeting, conditioning <br/>and, finally, packing for despatch.
