Calendering is done by pressing the paper web in one or more “rolling” nips <br/>formed by rolls with special properties

<p id="l10">
The objective of calendering is to modify the surface characteristics of paper with <br/>regard to its further use, <br/>These are mainly <br/>• gloss <br/>• smoothness/roughness <br/>• density <br/>• blackening <br/>• brightness <br/>• opacity. 
</p>
<span id="head-e663c0c2a7dd55162100bddd7aabb5bbc1e24624"><h2 id="l21"><strong>Various theoretical basis of calendering</strong></h2></span>
<p id="l23">
smoothness and gloss result from slipping of thepaper in the nips. <br/>flattening process where the smooth surface of the hard rolls is replicated on the side of the web that contacts the hard roll. <br/>shearing action in the nip which causes gloss and smoothness by “aligning” the surface particles of the web <br/>influence of heat: thermal energy transferred to the web softens the cellulose fibers (glass transition point) and thus enhances the development of gloss and smoothness. <br/>Smoothing the surface and increasing gloss are accompanied by reduction in caliper, strength properties, brightness and opacity to a certain degree. 
</p>
<span id="head-76bc5c05dbaa2fcd6c7167c402e733530f708ecd"><h2 id="l30"><strong>Factors</strong></h2></span>
<p id="l32">
The main factors in calendering – apart from furnish and paper properties are: <br/>• nip pressure/load <br/>• nip dwell time <br/>• roll elasticity <br/>• roll surface temperature and smoothness. 
</p>
<span id="head-7d1d7817ce794db5c50134286e25c320f223e31c"><h2 id="l38">Developments:</h2></span>
<p id="l39">
<strong>Crown rolls</strong> <br/>Conventional rolls deflect under the influence of the load and their dead weight, <br/>which would result in a nonuniform distribution of linear load in the press nips. <br/>To avoid this, the rolls had to be crowned, i. e. ground with a camber to <br/>apply uniform pressure distribution. The selected <br/>crown does, only apply to a certain load. If it were desired to alter the <br/>load, the rolls had to be re-crowned. 
</p>
<p id="l47">
<strong>Swimming Roll</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l49">
This roll consists of a fixed shaft with a shell rotating around it. <br/>Between the shaft and the shell is an oil-filled chamber. By adjusting the oil pressure <br/>in this chamber the shape of the roll shell can be changed . <br/>The swimming roll allows only control of the linear load distribution across the width <br/>only in a given overall shape 
</p>
<p id="l55">
<strong>Nipco rolls</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l57">
the load distribution can be controlled locally zonewise. On this <br/>roll the rotating roll shell is carried by a large number of hydrostatic supporting <br/>elements, which in turn are supported on a fixed shaft. In all, there are six to eight <br/>effective hydraulic zones.They can be controlled individually, the linear load can <br/>be specifically adjusted across the width of the calender. It is therefore possible not <br/>only to uniformly distribute the linear load across the roll width but also to increase <br/>or reduce it locally.

</p>
<p id="l67">
Machine calenders and supercalenders with width about 5000 mm and above <br/>are today equipped with zone-controlled rolls as standard 
</p>
<p id="l70">
<strong>Latest Development:</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l72">
The latest development is a calender (Voith’s Janus MK 2), on which the <br/>roll stack is no longer arranged vertically but at an angle of 45°. <br/>Janus Concept calender <br/>of Voith Paper) was built with all resilient rolls covered with special synthetic <br/>materials.It has  reduced number of nips, <br/>less energy input and – most noteworthy – suitability for on-line operation. 
</p>
<span id="head-be144a9d15ae86240227dc5b2075e7d7aced34f9"><h2 id="l79">The Different Calender Types</h2></span>
<p id="l81">
<strong>Machine Calendars:</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l83">
Machine calenders consist of two or more hard rolls and are practically always <br/>installed on-line. They are primarily used for paper that only requires moderate <br/>finishing or for pre-calendering grades  to obtain higher gloss and/or smoothness <br/>Machine calenders are equipped <br/>with overall deflection or zone-controlled deflection rolls 
</p>
<p id="l89">
<strong>Supercalenders</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l91">
Supercalenders are off-machine multiroll-calenders consisting of an unwind <br/>stand, a roller stack and a rewind stand.The rolls are hard and elastic.The hard rolls are steel or cast chilled iron rolls and are often heated <br/>The elastic rolls are filled rolls. The filling consists of a multitude of specialty paper sheets slid <br/>onto a steel shaft, compressed to the required hardness and then locked by nuts. 
</p>
<p id="l96">
<strong>Softcalenders</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l98">
Its main components are the soft covered deflection control roll and the heating roll. <br/>surface temperature of the heated roll can be up to 230 °C.In <br/>contrast to supercalenders, softcalenders can also be installed on line because the <br/>soft covers can withstand line loads, load cycles and temperatures that are much <br/>higher 
</p>
<p id="l105">
<strong>Modern Multinip-calenders</strong> 
</p>
<p id="l107">
Modern multinip-calenders are similar in function to supercalenders. The main <br/>difference is that the filled rolls are replaced by polymer covered rolls. As a result, <br/>modern multinip-calenders can be installed on-line and can be run more than <br/>twice as fast as supercalenders and with much higher surface temperatures and <br/>line loads. <br/>Today, there are three calender designs which make use of the new technology <br/>(Janus MK 2 calender of Voith, ProSoft calender of Küsters, and the OptiLoad <br/>calender of Metso). 
</p>
<p id="l116">
the stack being no longer arranged vertically but inclined at a 45° angle offering operational and technological <br/>advantages 
</p>
<p id="l119">
<strong>Extended Nip Calenders</strong> <br/>This technology is about to yield to <br/>extended nip calendering which provides two advantages, namely a speed that is <br/>much higher than that possible with the Yankee cylinder and a better relationship <br/>of smoothness versus bulk than can be obtained on a soft calender. 
</p>
<p id="l125">
<strong>Embossing Calenders</strong> <br/>The objective of embossing is to give the paper a three-dimensional pattern <br/>This is achieved by means of a single nip calender. <br/>There are three different embossing methods, namely “matrix” embossing, “flatback” <br/>embossing and “union” embossing. 
</p>
<p id="l131">
<strong>Friction Calenders</strong> <br/>The purpose of friction calendering is to impart glazing to the paper. Friction <br/>calenders are single or double nip machines in which all rolls are driven separately <br/>at speeds that differ by 10–30 %. They are mainly used for glazing playing cards.
