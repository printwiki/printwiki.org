<p id="l3">
<strong>Chromo paper</strong> <br/>A paper which is coated and then supercalendered (polished) on one side <br/>only. Used for greetings cards and label stock. <br/><strong>Cast-coated paper</strong> <br/>A paper which is coated in the conventional way but with the coating dried <br/>by passing the wet-coated web around a highly polished drying cylinder. <br/>This form of coating gives an improved gloss finish to the surface of the <br/>web. A variant of this process is known as Trulux, which uses a calendering <br/>process in which the soft coating is encouraged to flow under pressure and <br/>heat. <br/><strong>Kraft (bleached or unbleached)</strong> <br/>Produced from sulphate woodpulp, it is the strongest of all papers. Used <br/>mainly for wrappings but kraft pulp can be added to other furnishes to <br/>increase strength. <br/><strong>Hand-made paper</strong> <br/>Furnish is usually cotton, in the form of rags or cotton linters. Hand-made <br/>paper has good dimensional stability, random fibre orientation and good <br/>permanence and durability. It is extremely expensive to make, so is <br/>mostly used by artists for watercolour painting or for other specialist jobs. <br/><strong>Carbonless paper</strong> <br/>Produces copies when writing pressure is applied to the top sheet of a set. <br/>The set is made with special coatings on the appropriate sides of the <br/>sheets. Coated front (CF) is a receptive clay, while coated back (CB) contains <br/>microcapsules which break under writing pressure, releasing a <br/>colour former which reacts with the clay to form an image where the two <br/>coatings are in contact. Used for delivery notes, invoices, order forms etc. <br/><strong>Heat-sealable paper</strong> <br/>Uses a coating of heat-activated adhesive. Activation can either be instantaneous <br/>or delayed (useful where direct heat may damage the surface or <br/>product). Used for labels etc. <br/><strong>Pressure-sealable paper</strong> <br/>Uses a special polymer coating which is printable but bonds under pressure. <br/>Used for mailers. <br/><strong>Self-adhesive paper</strong> <br/>Applied to a silicone-coated backing sheet from which the permanently <br/>sticky paper can be peeled off when ready for contact application. <br/><strong>Machine-finished (MF)</strong> <br/>A paper which has been dried in contact with the drying cylinders on the <br/>papermaking machine to create smoothness and uniformity on both sides. <br/><strong>Matt-coated</strong> <br/>The base paper is coated with a coating mix which usually contains a mixture <br/>of latex/starch and ground calcium carbonate/china clay. The best mattcoated <br/>papers give a smooth non-reflective surface with low abrasivity and <br/>good ink hold-out. Typical descriptions are velvet, silk or matt art. <br/><strong>Gloss-coated</strong> <br/>Paper which has received this type of finish is also known as gloss art <br/>paper. The coating is applied, then the web is passed between two rollers, <br/>one highly polished steel, the other fibre packed. This gives the paper a <br/>very smooth surface with a high-gloss finish. Most high-quality art papers <br/>are coated at least once and sometimes three times on each side. <br/><strong>Machine-glazed (MG)</strong> <br/>A paper which has been dried against a highly polished drying cylinder <br/>known as a MG cylinder. This gives one side of the paper a smooth, <br/>glossy appearance while the other remains relatively rough. <br/>
